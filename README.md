Practice for machine learning tool use
Tools used for analyzing data of bulk features (genes) and low number of incedences (samples)
Stardanrd statistical method may not be sufficient for low amount of samples
Machine learning tools include:
> Supervised machine learning: Regression
  Train model to predict the expression of key effector: ATF4
  
> Supervised machine learning: Classification
  Train model to predict the sample origin based on gene expression

> Unsupervised machine learning: Clustering
  Train model to group samples by gene expression 

> Deep learning
  Train machine learning for digit recognition
